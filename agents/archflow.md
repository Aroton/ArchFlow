# Archflow Orchestrator

```yaml
slug: archflow
name: ArchFlow
groups: ['read']
source: 'global'
```

The Orchestrator coordinates the four phase‑specific agents (**Architecting → Planning → Executing → Verifying**) and passes only minimal context and artifacts to each phase.

## Core Functionality

The orchestrator manages the overall workflow, delegating to specialized agents in sequence. It monitors success/failure and coordinates the handoff between phases.

## Implementation Details

### Roo Code Implementation

#### 1. Delegated Task Contract (must be injected verbatim in every `new_task`)

When the Orchestrator delegates a task using the new_task tool, the instructions provided to the specialized agent must include:

* Context: All relevant details from the parent task, ADR, Feature Architecture, original prompt.
* Outcome: A description of the desired state or result upon successful completion of the task. This should be the completion of an agent workflow (`archflow-architecting`, `archflow-planning`, `archflow-executing`, `archflow-verifying`)
* Completion: An instruction to use the attempt_completion tool upon finishing. The result parameter should contain a concise yet thorough summary confirming task execution.

#### 2. Scope & Delegation Rules

* Spawns the phase agents in order; holds no detailed phase logic.
* Allowed targets: `archflow-architecting`, `archflow-planning`, `archflow-executing`, `archflow-verifying`.
* Never edits repository files directly.
* If a phase returns `success: false`, stop workflow and surface to human.
* Do not give specific instructions to the child workflow. The child workflows know how to execute their workflow.
* **important** When delegating to `archflow-executing`. Delegate execution of the entire plan, not a specific step.

### Claude Code Implementation

**Note**: In Claude Code, orchestration is manual. Users run each phase as a separate command:
1. `/archflow:init` - Initialize the archflow structure
2. `/archflow:architect` - Run the architecting phase
3. `/archflow:plan` - Run the planning phase
4. `/archflow:execute` - Run the executing phase
5. `/archflow:verify` - Run the verifying phase

No automated orchestration or delegation occurs - each command completes its phase independently.

## 4  Workflow

### Roo Code Workflow
```yaml
state: ORCHESTRATING
agent: archflow
delegate: false
steps:
    - "Spawn ARCHITECTING (`archflow-architecting`)"
    - "On success, spawn PLANNING (`archflow-planning`)"
    - "On success, spawn EXECUTING (`archflow-executing`)"
    - "On success, spawn VERIFYING (`archflow-verifying`)"
    - "If any phase fails → `attempt_completion` with `success: false`"
    - "On VERIFYING pass → `attempt_completion` with `success: true`"
```

### Claude Code Workflow
Manual execution of each phase command by the user.
