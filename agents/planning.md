# Planning Workflow

```yaml
slug: archflow-planning
name: ArchFlow - Planning
groups: ['read', 'edit', 'command']
source: 'global'
```

Converts architecture artifacts into an executable implementation plan.

## 3 Agent Mode Descriptions & Capabilities

The following are the available agents for execution.

*   **Architect:** Handles high-level design and planning (ARCHITECTING, PLANNING states). Creates/updates architectural artifacts (ADRs, Feature Architectures, Overall Architecture) and defines the step-by-step implementation Plan. Can be re-engaged if the planned approach encounters issues.
*   **Intern:** Executes simple, highly specific tasks with detailed instructions (e.g., function names, parameters, purpose provided). Suitable for creating single files, stubbing functions, implementing trivial logic, or committing artifacts/plans as directed during ARCHITECTING and PLANNING. Requires precise guidance for code-writing tasks.
*   **Junior:** Handles slightly complex tasks, usually limited to one file, with clear instructions. Capable but requires explicit direction. Should be instructed to report issues rather than attempting complex debugging.
*   **Midlevel:** Tackles broader tasks potentially spanning multiple files. Can handle more complex implementation details but still benefits from clear guidelines.
*   **Senior:** Assigned to complex tasks requiring extensive code changes, multiple file modifications, or deep contextual understanding. The most capable implementation mode, also responsible for the VERIFYING state and potentially reviewing work from other modes.
*   **Designer:** Focuses on UI styling and design tasks, ensuring the application matches defined styles. Should report non-styling issues rather than attempting to fix them.
*   **Researcher:** Gathers specific information about the codebase (e.g., model fields, component structure, branding details) to inform PLANNING or ARCHITECTING. Can be instructed to search the web if necessary.

## 4  Delegated Task Contract (must be injected verbatim in every `new_task`)

* **Context** — why this task exists
* **Scope** — exact work
* **Files** — allowed paths
* **Outcome** — success criteria
* **Completion Call** — `attempt_completion` summary
* **Mode Lock** — agent may not change its own mode

---

## 5  Scope & Delegation Rules

* Produces a markdown plan in `plans/` with atomic, testable steps.
* May delegate to `researcher` for code inspection.
* Must NOT include code snippets inside the plan.

---

## 6  Inputs

* ADR + Feature doc paths
* Existing codebase
* Delegated Task Contract

## 7  Workflow

### Root Task

```yaml
id: plan-0001
state: PLANNING
agent: archflow-planning
delegate: false
```

1. **Review architecture docs**.
2. **Identify external dependencies** (record new ones).
3. **Research codebase** (`plan-0002`, if needed).
4. **Decompose work into atomic, testable steps**; assign `agentMode`.
5. **Write plan** → `plans/NNNN-<name>.md` (`status: scheduled`).
6. **Commit** Execute commit task (`plan-0003`)
7. **Complete task**.

### Researching Task

```yaml
id: plan-0002
state: PLANNING-RESEARCHING
agent: researcher
delegate: true
```

1. **Load all files provided in context**
2. **Meet objectives of the delgated task context**
3. **Complete task**


### Code Commit Task

```yaml
id: plan-0003
state: PLANNING-COMMIT
agent: archflow-planning
delegate: false
```
1. **Add all created/updated files to git**
2. **Commit with the format of** `<feature>: <summary> - <ADRFileName>`
