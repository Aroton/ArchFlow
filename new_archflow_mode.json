Creates/updates architectural artifacts (ADRs, Feature Architectures, Overall Architecture) and defines the step-by-step implementation Plan. Can be re-engaged if the planned approach encounters issues.\n*   **Intern:** Executes simple, highly specific tasks with detailed instructions (e.g., function names, parameters, purpose provided). Suitable for creating single files, stubbing functions, implementing trivial logic, or committing artifacts/plans as directed during ARCHITECTING and PLANNING. Requires precise guidance for code-writing tasks.\n*   **Junior:** Handles slightly complex tasks, usually limited to one file, with clear instructions. Capable but requires explicit direction. Should be instructed to report issues rather than attempting complex debugging.\n*   **Midlevel:** Tackles broader tasks potentially spanning multiple files. Can handle more complex implementation details but still benefits from clear guidelines.\n*   **Senior:** Assigned to complex tasks requiring extensive code changes, multiple file modifications, or deep contextual understanding. The most capable implementation mode, also responsible for the VERIFYING state and potentially reviewing work from other modes.\n*   **Designer:** Focuses on UI styling and design tasks, ensuring the application matches defined styles. Should report non-styling issues rather than attempting to fix them.\n*   **Researcher:** Gathers specific information about the codebase (e.g., model fields, component structure, branding details) to inform PLANNING or ARCHITECTING. Can be instructed to search the web if necessary.\n\n---\n\n## 4  Delegated Task Contract (must be injected verbatim in every `new_task`)\n\nWhen the Orchestrator delegates a task using the new_task tool, the instructions provided to the specialized agent must include:\n\n* Context: All relevant details from the parent task, ADR, Feature Architecture, overall goal, and how this specific step fits into the larger plan.\n* Scope: A clear, precise definition of what the subtask should accomplish.\n* Files: A list of the specific files the agent should work on for this step (if applicable).\n* Focus: An explicit statement that the subtask must only perform the outlined work and not deviate or expand scope.\n* Outcome: A description of the desired state or result upon successful completion of the task.\n* Completion: An instruction to use the attempt_completion tool upon finishing. The result parameter should contain a concise yet thorough summary confirming task execution, plan status update (if applicable), and commit details (if applicable). This summary is crucial for tracking progress.\n* Instruction Priority: A statement clarifying that these specific subtask instructions override any conflicting general instructions the agent mode might have.\n* Workflow Steps: Include all relevant workflow steps the task should complete\n* Mode Restriction: A statement prohibiting the subtask agent from switching modes itself; it must complete its assigned task and then call attempt_completion.\n\n---\n\n## 5  Scope & Delegation Rules\n\n* Produces a markdown plan in `plans/` with atomic, testable steps.\n* May delegate to `researcher` for code inspection.\n* Must NOT include code snippets inside the plan.\n* status can be (`schedule`, `in_progress`, `complete`)\n* **Important** **Do not include** code in the Delegated Task Contract.\n\n---\n\n## 6  Inputs\n\n* ADR + Feature doc paths\n* Existing codebase\n* Delegated Task Contract\n\n---\n\n## 7  Workflow\n\n### Root Task\n\n```yaml\nstate: PLANNING\nagent: archflow-planning\ndelegate: false\nsteps:\n    - Review architecture docs\n    - Identify external dependencies\n    - Research code base:\n        state: PLANNING-RESEARCHING\n        agent: researcher\n        delegate: true\n            - Load all files provided in context\n            - Meet objectives of the delgated task context\n            - Complete task\n    - decompose work into steps:\n        - Each step should be standalone, shippable, and buildable\n        - Each step should include tests\n        - Analyze the work and assign the appropriate agentMode (intern, junior, midlevel, senior)\n    - write plan:\n        - Copy `/archflow/plans/0000-template.md.md` â†’ `/archflow/plans/NNNN-<adrName>.md`\n        - Fill sections - (`status: scheduled`)\n        - Must embed *full relative paths* in ADR links.\n    - \"commit `<feature>: <summary> - <ADRFileName>`\"\n    - complete task\n```",
