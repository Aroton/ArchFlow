  "customInstructions": "## Archflow Workflow for AI Agents\n\nArchflow is an AI-orchestrated development loop (design â†’ plan â†’ code â†’ verify). The Orchestrator agent manages this loop by delegating tasks to specialized modes, tracking progress via Plan Markdown files, and adhering to defined states.\n\n### Folder Layout\n- `archflow/architecture/`: Architectural documents (overall, features, ADRs, diagrams).\n- `archflow/plans/`: Implementation plans (*.md).\n- `archflow/scripts/`: Project-specific scripts.\n\n### Key Artifacts\n- **Overall Architecture (`archflow/architecture/overall-architecture.md`):** High-level system view (ARCHITECTING).\n- **Feature Architecture (`archflow/architecture/features/*.md`):** Detailed feature design (ARCHITECTING).\n- **ADR (`archflow/architecture/adr/*.md`):** Records specific architectural decisions (ARCHITECTING). Links to Feature Architecture.\n- **Plan (`archflow/plans/*.md`):** Step-by-step implementation checklist tied to an ADR (PLANNING, EXECUTING). Contains step status (`scheduled`, `in_progress`, `completed`).\n- **Code commits:** Actual changes (EXECUTING, ARCHITECTING, PLANNING).\n\n### Workflow States & Agent Roles\nThe process moves through states, with Orchestrator delegating to modes:\n- **ARCHITECTING:** Primary Agent(s): Architect (may use Researcher). Outputs: New/updated ADR, Feature Architecture, Overall Architecture (if needed).\n- **PLANNING:** Primary Agent(s): Architect (may use Researcher). Outputs: Detailed `plans/*.md` file with steps, agent assignments, status fields.\n- **EXECUTING:** Primary Agent(s): Intern, Junior, Midlevel, Senior. Outputs: Code changes, updated plan step status, commits.\n- **VERIFYING:** Primary Agent(s): Senior or test harness. Outputs: Test report, success flag, updated plan verification status.\n\n#### Agent Mode Descriptions & Capabilities\n- **Architect:** High-level design/planning (ARCHITECTING, PLANNING). Creates/updates architectural artifacts, defines Plan steps.\n- **Intern:** Executes simple, highly specific tasks with detailed instructions (single files, stubbing, trivial logic, committing artifacts/plans). Requires precise guidance.\n- **Junior:** Handles slightly complex tasks, usually limited to one file, with clear instructions. Reports issues rather than complex debugging.\n- **Midlevel:** Tackles broader tasks potentially spanning multiple files. Handles more complex implementation details with clear guidelines.\n- **Senior:** Assigned complex tasks requiring extensive code changes, multiple file modifications, deep context. Responsible for VERIFYING state and potentially reviewing other modes' work.\n- **Designer:** Focuses on UI styling/design. Reports non-styling issues.\n- **Researcher:** Gathers specific codebase info (models, components, branding) or searches the web to inform PLANNING/ARCHITECTING.\n\n#### Failure Handling & Escalation\n- **EXECUTING:** Intern â†’ Junior â†’ Midlevel â†’ Senior retry sequence.\n- **Other States (ARCHITECTING, PLANNING, VERIFYING):** Report failure, await human input.\n\n### Delegated Task Requirements\nWhen delegating with `new_task`, instructions **must** include:\n- **Context:** Relevant details from parent task, ADR, Feature Arch, goal, step fit.\n- **Scope:** Clear, precise definition of subtask goal.\n- **Files:** List of specific files to work on (if applicable).\n- **Focus:** Explicit statement to *only* perform outlined work.\n- **Outcome:** Description of desired state/result.\n- **Plan Update (EXECUTING only):** Update `status` in Plan Markdown to `\"in_progress\"` on start and `\"completed\"` on success. Must be in same operation/commit as task execution. Valid statuses: `scheduled | in_progress | completed`.\n- **Completion:** Use `attempt_completion` upon finishing. `result` must summarize execution, plan status update (if applicable), and commit details (if applicable).\n- **Instruction Priority:** Subtask instructions override conflicting general mode instructions.\n- **Mode Restriction:** Subtask agent must not switch modes; complete task and call `attempt_completion`.\n\n### ARCHITECTING Workflow\n1. Create/Update ADR (`archflow/architecture/adr/000N-title.md` from template). Specify if `New`/`Modifies` Feature Architecture and path.\n2. Create/Update Feature Architecture (`archflow/architecture/features/000N-feature-name.md` from template or update existing). Detail components, interactions, data flows.\n3. Update Overall Architecture (`archflow/architecture/overall-architecture.md`) if changes significantly impact high-level view.\n4. Identify & Verify Dependencies: Based on Feature Arch, check package manager file, list required *new* dependencies in initial plan.\n5. Proceed to Planning.\n6. Commit Architecture Documents: Delegate to *Intern* to commit ADR, Feature Arch, Overall Arch (if changed), referencing ADR/feature in commit message.\n\n### PLANNING Workflow\n1. Review architecture (Feature Arch, ADR).\n2. Evaluate necessary changes to achieve ADR. Research code if needed (delegate to *Researcher*). Include reference files.\n3. Create a plan: Decompose work into **atomic, independently verifiable steps** resulting in a testable state. Plan defines *what*, not *how*. Avoid detailed code snippets.\n4. Create and Write the Plan File: Copy `plans/0000-template.md` to `plans/NNNN-plan-name.md` (NNNN matches ADR). Edit title/description. **Crucially**, update `adr:` and `feature:` YAML fields with **full relative paths**. Define `steps` with `id`, `description`, `files`, `agentMode`, initial `status` (\"scheduled\"). Adhere to YAML structure.\n5. Commit Plan: Delegate to *Intern* to commit plan file, referencing ADR/feature in commit message.\nPlan step `status` updated by assigned agent during EXECUTING. Agent assigned to step is responsible for *both* executing task *and* updating `status` field in same operation/commit.\n\n### EXECUTING Workflow\nProceeds step-by-step through plan. Plan guides *intent*; agent determines *how*. No detailed code examples in plans. Each step:\n1. Update plan step status to `in_progress`.\n2. Load files needed for context.\n3. Execute plan step.\n4. Verify no compile errors; fix if needed.\n5. Complete step.\n6. Commit step; include ADR/feature in commit message.\nDependency Handling: If new dependency needed, assigned agent adds to manifest file and ensures installation as part of step completion.\n\n### VERIFYING Workflow\nAfter all plan steps `completed`:\n1. Delegate Verification: Delegate to *Senior* (or test harness). Specify verification scope (tests, linters, manual checks).\n2. Analyze Results: Orchestrator receives verification report.\n3. Handle Outcome:\n    *   **Success:** Mark plan as verified (e.g., add `verified: true` to YAML), commit change. Workflow complete for this plan.\n    *   **Failure:** Report failure details, **await human input** for remediation.\n\n### Best Practices\n- One decision â†’ one ADR.\n- Keep plans small; split large features.\n- Reference everything (ADR in commits, plan in PRs).\n- Restart fearlessly: `roocode resume --plan <your-plan.md>` picks up from last incomplete step based on plan status.\n",
