         participant User
         participant Frontend
         participant Backend API
         participant AI Service
         participant Database
         User->>Frontend: Initiates Feature Action
         Frontend->>Backend API: Sends Request Data
         Backend API->>AI Service: Processes Request (e.g., inference, data prep)
         AI Service-->>Backend API: Returns AI Result/Data
         Backend API->>Database: Stores/Retrieves Data
         Database-->>Backend API: Returns Data
         Backend API-->>Frontend: Sends Processed Response
         Frontend-->>User: Displays Result/Updates UI
     ```
   - **3.2. Individual Component Sequence Diagrams:** Detailed diagrams for specific, complex interactions within or between components (e.g., detailed AI model interaction, complex data processing steps). Add as needed for clarity using Mermaid.

## 4. Filesystem Structure
   - **4.1. Backend Filesystem:** Proposed directory and file organization for backend code, configuration, models, tests, etc. Provide a tree structure example.
   - **4.2. Frontend Filesystem:** Proposed directory and file organization for frontend code, components, assets, styles, tests, etc. Provide a tree structure example.

## 5. Data Management
   - **5.1. Database Schemas:** Definitions for necessary database tables, fields, types, relationships, indexes, etc. (Can be SQL DDL, NoSQL document structure examples, Mermaid ERD, etc.).
   - **5.2. Configuration Definitions:** Structure, keys, value types, and descriptions for configuration files, environment variables, or feature flags needed. Provide examples (e.g., YAML, JSON).

## 6. API Definitions
   - **6.1. Backend APIs:** Detailed specifications for APIs exposed by the backend (e.g., REST endpoints with methods, paths, request/response bodies using OpenAPI snippets; GraphQL schemas; gRPC service definitions).
   - **6.2. Frontend APIs (if applicable):** Description of how frontend components communicate or manage state internally, if complex (e.g., state management actions/reducers, event bus patterns).

## 7. Technical Details
   - **7.1. Dependencies:** List of key libraries, frameworks, external services (including specific AI services/models), and tools required. Include versions if important.
   - **7.2. Security Considerations:** Analysis of potential security threats (e.g., data privacy, input manipulation, model vulnerabilities, authentication/authorization) and planned mitigation strategies.
   - **7.3. Scalability & Performance:** Design considerations for handling expected load, ensuring responsiveness, and potential scaling strategies (e.g., caching, load balancing, asynchronous processing, database optimization).
   - **7.4. Monitoring & Logging:** Strategy for logging key events, monitoring system health (metrics, dashboards), and diagnosing issues. Include AI-specific monitoring (e.g., model drift, prediction confidence, resource usage).

## 8. Testing Strategy
   - **8.1. Unit Tests:** Approach for testing individual functions, classes, or components in isolation. Mention frameworks/tools.
   - **8.2. Integration Tests:** Approach for testing the interaction between different components (e.g., API and database, frontend and backend). Mention frameworks/tools.
