# Overall System Architecture

*Last Updated*: {YYYY-MM-DD}

## 1. System Overview & Goals

- **1.1. Purpose:** Briefly describe the system's primary function, target users, and core business value.
- **1.2. Key Goals:** List the main non-functional goals driving the architecture (e.g., scalability, reliability, maintainability, security compliance).

## 2. High-Level Architecture Diagram

- **2.1. System Context/Container Diagram:** A visual representation (e.g., C4 model, simple block diagram) showing the major logical components/services (Frontend, Backend API, Core Services, Databases, External Integrations) and their primary relationships.
  ```mermaid

      A[User] --> B(Frontend SPA);
      B --> C{Backend API Gateway};
      C --> D[Auth Service];
      C --> E[Feature Service 1];
      C --> F[Feature Service 2];
      E --> G[(Database)];
      F --> G;
      C --> H{External System X};
  ```
- **2.2. Component Responsibilities:** Briefly describe the main responsibility of each major component shown in the diagram.
    - *Component A:* ...
    - *Component B:* ...

## 3. Key Architectural Principles & Patterns

- List the core principles guiding design decisions (e.g., Domain-Driven Design, Microservices, Event-Driven Architecture, Serverless First, Hexagonal Architecture).
- Briefly explain *why* these principles/patterns were chosen.

## 4. Major Technology Choices

- **Languages/Frameworks:** (e.g., Python/FastAPI, TypeScript/React, Go)
- **Databases:** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)
- **Infrastructure:** (e.g., AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, Serverless Functions)
- **Key Libraries/Services:** (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, Specific AI/ML platforms)

## 5. Cross-Cutting Concerns

- **5.1. Authentication & Authorization:** High-level approach (e.g., OAuth2/OIDC, JWT, Service-to-service auth).
- **5.2. Monitoring & Logging:** Overall strategy and tools (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana, ELK Stack, Datadog).
- **5.3. Deployment:** High-level CI/CD strategy (e.g., GitOps, Jenkins pipeline, Cloud provider tools).

- **Feature Architectures:** [Link to architecture/features/ directory or index]
- **API Documentation:** [Link to Swagger/OpenAPI/GraphQL docs]
- **Other Relevant Docs:** (e.g., Security policies, Runbooks)
