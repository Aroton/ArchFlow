# ArchFlow Project

ArchFlow is a multi-agent system designed to automate and streamline the software development lifecycle, from architectural design through to verification. It utilizes a series of specialized agents, each responsible for a distinct phase of the process.

The core of ArchFlow is an **Orchestrator** that coordinates these phase-specific agents, ensuring a smooth transition of tasks and artifacts.

## Project Structure

The project follows a defined folder structure to manage artifacts:

```
.
└── archflow/                 # Root directory created by init script
    ├── architecture/
    │   ├── overall-architecture.md # High-level system view
    │   ├── features/             # Detailed feature architectures
    │   │   └── NNNN-feature-name.md # Example feature doc
    │   ├── adr/                  # Architecture Decision Records (ADR)
    │   │   ├── 0000-template.md  # Copy & rename for each new decision
    │   │   ├── 0001-...md        # First accepted ADR
    │   │   └── 0002-...md
    │   └── diagrams/             # Images referenced by ADRs or feature docs
    ├── plans/                    # Implementation plans (*.md)
    └── scripts/                  # Project-specific scripts (if applicable)
```

## Core Agents

The ArchFlow system is composed of the following key agents:

*   **[ArchFlow Orchestrator (archflow)](agents/archflow.md)**: This agent coordinates the four phase-specific agents: Architecting, Planning, Executing, and Verifying. It manages the overall workflow and passes minimal context and artifacts between phases. See [`agents/archflow.md`](agents/archflow.md:1) for more details.

*   **[Architecting (archflow-architecting)](agents/architecting.md)**: Responsible for creating and updating architectural documents, including Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), feature architectures, and the overall system architecture. It may delegate research tasks. More information can be found in [`agents/architecting.md`](agents/architecting.md:1).

*   **[Planning (archflow-planning)](agents/planning.md)**: This agent takes the architectural artifacts and converts them into a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan. Each step is designed to be atomic and testable. Details are in [`agents/planning.md`](agents/planning.md:1).

*   **[Executing (archflow-executing)](agents/executing.md)**: Implements the code according to the plan generated by the Planning agent. It ensures that each step builds, lints, and tests cleanly, potentially delegating tasks to sub-agents of varying skill levels. Refer to [`agents/executing.md`](agents/executing.md:1) for the full workflow.

*   **[Verifying (archflow-verifying)](agents/verifying.md)**: Acts as the final quality gate. It runs verification suites (unit tests, integration tests, linters) and performs code reviews to ensure the implemented solution meets standards and requirements. The verification process is detailed in [`agents/verifying.md`](agents/verifying.md:1).

Each agent operates based on a "Delegated Task Contract" which defines the context, scope, allowed files, outcome criteria, and completion call for any task it undertakes.
